        <h3>AI Business Idea Review</h3>
<p>
  I explored an AI business concept called an “AI Personal Tutor,” which supports students by offering personalized guidance while they study. I found it helpful for my own coursework, and it has also benefited friends I introduced it to. A key ethical concern is protecting users’ personal data, so a good solution is to use strong privacy and security measures to keep information safe.

        <h3>Personal Development</h3>
       <p><strong>Chapter 4:</strong> This chapter focuses on the importance of setting clear goals. I learned that goals give direction and help shape success, so I’m working on making steady progress each day. Setting goals is the easy part, but following through consistently takes discipline.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5:</strong> This chapter emphasizes time management. It taught me to use my time more intentionally by prioritizing important tasks while still making time for life outside school. I try to maintain a healthy balance so I can stay productive without burning out.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 6:</strong> This chapter highlights the value of relationships. I’ve learned that even though I may not always involve myself deeply, I can still grow by observing, listening, and learning from my classmates and friends—especially those with strong long-term relationships and experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7:</strong> This chapter teaches the importance of continuous learning. I stay curious and enjoy building new skills, and looking back, that mindset has always been part of who I am. Since I was younger, I’ve naturally been drawn to trying new things, and that has helped me grow over time.</p>
